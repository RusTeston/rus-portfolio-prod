# Deployment Discipline Agreement
## Rus Portfolio Migration Project

**Date**: October 26, 2025  
**Participants**: Rus Teston & Amazon Q  
**Project**: rus-teston.com Portfolio Migration to AWS Best Practices  

---

## 🤝 **MUTUAL AGREEMENT**

We, Rus Teston and Amazon Q, hereby agree to follow these deployment discipline practices throughout the entire portfolio migration project. This agreement serves as our binding commitment to quality, safety, and methodical execution.

---

## 🛡️ **CORE PRINCIPLES**

### **Principle 1: Quality Over Speed**
- We prioritize correctness over completion time
- We will not rush any step to meet arbitrary deadlines
- We will take time to understand each step before execution

### **Principle 2: Test Everything**
- No changes to live systems without prior testing
- Every script, every file, every configuration gets validated
- Testing is not optional - it is mandatory

### **Principle 3: Document Everything**
- Every decision gets recorded with rationale
- Every test gets documented with results
- Every change gets logged with timestamp and purpose

### **Principle 4: Explicit Approval Required**
- No phase proceeds without explicit approval from Rus
- Amazon Q will not make assumptions about readiness to proceed
- "Looks good" is not sufficient - explicit "APPROVED TO PROCEED" required

---

## 📋 **MANDATORY PROCESS STEPS**

### **Before ANY Action:**
1. **PROPOSE** - Amazon Q describes exactly what will be done
2. **REVIEW** - Rus reviews and asks questions
3. **TEST PLAN** - Define how we'll validate it worked
4. **ROLLBACK PLAN** - Define how to undo if needed
5. **APPROVAL** - Rus gives explicit written approval
6. **EXECUTE** - Perform the action
7. **VALIDATE** - Test that it worked as expected
8. **DOCUMENT** - Record results, update project documentation

### **Checkpoint System:**
```
Phase → Plan → Review → Test Plan → Approval → Execute → Validate → Document → Next Phase
```

**NO SKIPPING STEPS** - Each step must be completed before proceeding.

## 🚨 **SAFETY RULES**

### **Rule 1: No Live Changes Without Testing**
- ✅ **ALWAYS** test in new/separate environment first
- ✅ **ALWAYS** validate functionality before touching live site
- ❌ **NEVER** modify rustestonsite bucket until new structure is proven
- ❌ **NEVER** change DNS until new site is fully tested

### **Rule 2: Immediate Stop Protocol**
If ANYTHING unexpected happens:
1. **STOP** all activity immediately
2. **ASSESS** what went wrong
3. **DOCUMENT** the issue
4. **PLAN** the fix or rollback
5. **GET APPROVAL** before continuing

### **Rule 3: Rollback Readiness**
- Every change must have a documented rollback procedure
- Rollback procedures must be tested before making changes
- Original systems stay intact until migration is proven successful

### **Rule 4: Explicit Approval Language**
Rus must use these exact phrases for approval:
- **"APPROVED TO PROCEED"** - Go ahead with proposed action
- **"HOLD - NEED CLARIFICATION"** - Stop, explain more
- **"REJECTED - REVISE PLAN"** - Don't proceed, need new approach
